# Algorithms

Popular algorithms implemented in Typescript.

## Setup

First, install dependencies:

```sh
$ yarn
```

Commands are divided by algorithm name. So, if you want launch bubble sort then run:

```sh
$ yarn bubble-sort
```

## Status

Work in progress; I will be implementing more in my free time.

- ✅ Bubble sort
- ✅ Selection sort
